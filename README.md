# PRODIGY_CS_01

This repository contains the Python code for the Caesar Cipher implementation, completed as the first task of my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy Infotech.

Features:

Implements both encryption and decryption functionalities. User-friendly interface allows for easy input and output. Handles both lowercase and uppercase letters, preserving case. Accommodates non-alphabetic characters, leaving them unchanged.

Benefits:

Provides a practical example of a simple encryption algorithm. Demonstrates basic cryptography concepts through code implementation. Serves as a foundation for exploring more complex ciphers.
